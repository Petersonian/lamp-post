			<p>Some rogues favor honing their skill and precision, others perfect a silver tongue, but you—well, you’ve always gotten a kick out of leaving things up to chance. Rogues of the Wild Card variety thrive on the high stakes and random thrill of the game table. Armed with cunning cheats and no small amount of luck, these sly gamblers live and die by their rules, never keen to simply accept the hand fate deals them.</p>

			<p>Your penchant for games has afforded you the ability to subtly manipulate fortune to your favor. When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn the <em>guidance</em> cantrip. Starting at 9th level, it has a range of 30 feet for you, and you can cast it as a bonus action.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Also at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with one of the following gaming sets: dice set, dragonchess set, or playing card set.</p>
		</description>
		<sheet>
			<description> 
				<p>Instead of a Sneak Attack this turn, take a card and attack a creature within 30 feet with it (use Dex mod). On hit, it deals slashing damage equal 1d4 + your Dex mod. Use the 1d4 to gain an effect from below.</p>
				<p>Uses = <<stat name="charisma" value="2" /> (minimum of once), and regain all uses after a long rest. </p>
				<p>>Wild Card's Gambit</p>
				<p>1-Blade. Roll your Sneak Attack damage and add it to your razor card’s damage. At the start of its next turn, the target takes additional damage equal to half the Sneak Attack damage rolled.</p>
				<p>2-Shackle. Until the start of your next turn, the target’s speed is halved. It can’t make more than one attack on its turn while its speed is reduced in this way.</p>
				<p>3-Heart. Roll your Sneak Attack damage and add it to your razor card’s damage. You also immediately regain a number of hit points equal to the half the damage dealt. Any excess hit points regains become temporary hit points.</p>
				<p>4-Wild Ace. This card morphs suits depending on the dealer’s wishes. Choose Blade, Shackle, or Heart. The card then immediately gains the suit’s respective effect.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Starting at 9th level, you are acutely aware of how to quit when you’re ahead, vanishing in a flash when the odds begin to turn against you. As a bonus action, you can disappear with a dramatic flourish. Each creature within 10 feet of you must make a Dexterity saving throw ({{shifting the odds:dc}}), taking 4d10 force damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one.</p>
			<p>You then teleport yourself to an unoccupied space that you can see within 120 feet of your original location. Once you have used this ability, you cannot use it again until you have finished a short or long rest.</p>

			<p>At 13th level, your mastery over the game table hones your speed and cunning in combat. After rolling initiative but before the first turn of combat, you can choose to swap places in the initiative order with one creature you can see. If the creature is one of your allies, that ally must agree to swapping initiative with you.</p>

		<description>
			<p>At 17th level, your mastery over chance encompasses even your own form, allowing you to exist between potential realities. As a bonus action on your turn, you can take on an incorporeal form, during which you gain the following benefits:</p>
			<p>You regain all spent uses of Wild Card's Gambit. </p>
			<p>Your movement speed is doubled. </p>
			<p>You gain resistance to all damage, and are immune to the grappled, paralyzed, stunned, and restrained conditions. </p>
			<p>You can move through objects and creatures as if they were difficult terrain. If you end your turn inside a creature, the creature takes 1d10 force damage and is shunted into an adjacent space within 5 feet of their original location.</p>
			<p> This incorporeal state lasts for one minute, or until you are incapacitated. Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you complete a long rest. </p>
